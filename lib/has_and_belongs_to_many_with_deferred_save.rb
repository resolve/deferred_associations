      # Replace your existing call to has_and_belongs_to_many with has_and_belongs_to_many_with_deferred_save.
      #
      # Then add a validation method that adds an error if there is something wrong with the (unsaved) collection. This will prevent it from being saved if there are any errors.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #  def validate
      #    if people.size > maximum_occupancy
      #      errors.add :people, "There are too many people in this room"

          # records that have changed.

          # knowing that we've changed its behavior. It expects that method to return the elements of that collection that are in the *database*
          # (the original behavior), so we have to provide that behavior...  If we didn't provide it, it would end up trying to take the diff of
          # two identical collections so nothing would ever get saved.
